    "\n",
    "In our lecture on NumPy we learned one method, called **vectorization**, to improve speed and efficiency in numerical work. Vectorization involves sending array processing operations in batch to efficient low level code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, vectorization has several weaknesses:\n",
    "- One is that it is highly memory intensive when working with large amounts of data.\n",
    "- Another is that not all algorithms can be vectorized. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Python library called [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) solves many of these problems. It does so through something called **just in time (JIT) compilation**. \n",
    "The key idea is to compile functions to native machine code instructions on the fly. When it succeeds, the compiled code is extreamely fast. \n",
    "It can also do other tricks such as facilitate *multithreading* (a form of parallelization well suited to numerical work).\n"

    "### How and When it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba attempts to generate fast machine code using the infrastructure provided by the [LLVM Project](http://llvm.org/). \n",
    "It does this by inferring type information on the fly.\n",
    "This is easier for simple Python objects (simple scalar data types, such as floats, integers, etc.). Numba also plays well with NumPy arrays, which it treats as typed memory regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal setting, Numba can infer all necessary type information.\n",
    "This allows it to generate native machine code, without having to call the Python runtime environment.\n",
    "In such a setting, Numba will be on par with machine code from low level languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Numba cannot infer all type information, some Python objects are given generic `object` status, and some code is generated using the Python runtime.\n",
    "When this happens, Numba provides only minor speed gains or none at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "We generally prefer to force an error when this occurs, so we know effective compilation is failing. This is done by using either `@jit(nopython=True)` or, equivalently, `@njit` instead of `@jit`."
